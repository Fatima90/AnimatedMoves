# MVP (Solo) Project

## Overview:

You have four days to produce a website or app of your dreams using the skills you've honed over the past weeks.

Q: What are your inputs?
A: Four days of (relatively) undivided attention

Q: What is the required output?
A: A compelling product presentation delivered to your classmates.

## What is an MVP?
MVP stands for '[minimum viable product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)'. It is a product that has just enough features to understand how to use it and what it is for.

You can read more about MVPs [here](https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-minimum-viable-product).

## Getting Started:
To build on your learning of core engineering concepts, we will begin thinking about how to actually manage projects. Engineering management is a deep skill and discipline with lots of history and academic writing. We will focus on just some highlights of content to give a very brief context of how we arrive here.

* Use an [Iterative and incremental development process](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_and_incremental_development) instead of a [Waterfall Process](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model)


## Regarding APIs

We want you to use an API for your project. What does this mean? This means using someone's information to display on your website.
Below are APIs that are free. If you find an API that requires you to pay, sometimes there is a one-week or one-month free trial. Feel free to sign up for the free trial but remember that you need to cancel it or else you will get charged!

## Basic Requirements

- [ ] Fork the repo
- Complete the _PRESS-RELEASE.md template (<60min)
  - [ ] Pick an idea (implement a technology, build a product, make art, etc).
  - [ ] Write it down on paper
  - [ ] Imagine what portion of this could be done in 24 hours.
  - [ ] Cut the scope in half.
  - [ ] Cut the above scope in half again.
  - [ ] Fill in the README.md template document
- [ ] Use iterative development (go straight to something that demo's your idea)
- [ ] Decide on the technologies that you want to use
  - [ ] Must use one front-end framework (i.e. Backbone or React)
  - [ ] Optional: d3
  - [ ] Optional: ES6
  - [ ] Optional: jQuery
  - [ ] Optional: Underscore
  - [ ] Optional: Bootstrap CSS
- [ ] Use CSS to style your MVP and make it look understandable and appealing.
- [ ] Run 'npm init' on this repo and follow the directions in your command line
- [ ] Must use a third-party API. Here are some examples:
  * [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/web/)
  * [Any of the other Google APIs](https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#p/)
  * [Weather](openweathermap.org)
  * [New York Times](http://developer.nytimes.com/)
  * [United States government census data](http://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets.html)
  * [United States government's data](https://www.data.gov/developers/apis)
  * [NASA](https://data.nasa.gov/about)
  * [LOTS OF DATA](http://commoncrawl.org/)

  * [Twitter](https://dev.twitter.com/)
  * [Flickr - photos](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/)
  * [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api)
  * [YouTube](https://developers.google.com/youtube/)
  * [Kandy - video messaging & calling](https://developer.kandy.io/)
  * [Meerkat - livestream video](http://developers.meerkatapp.co/)
  * [Slack](https://api.slack.com/web)
  * [Sheetsu - Turn your Google Spreadsheet into an API](https://sheetsu.com/)
  * [Text to Speech](https://market.mashape.com/warting/text-to-speech-3#!documentation)
  * [Numbers - fun facts](https://market.mashape.com/divad12/numbers-1#!documentation)
  * [Riot Games](https://developer.riotgames.com/)
  * Do you have another API you want to use? Let us know!
- [ ] Prepare for pitch @ demo on Thursday

## Extra Credit

- [ ] Storage - if you want your app to persist data, use a tool like Parse or Firebase.
- [ ] Use more than one API!

## What We Want to See

We understand how difficult it is to create an MVP!

Here are three things we want to see from you:

* Effort -- this is the most important thing. We want to see effort---this means being curious. This means working hard. This means staying positive about your skills. How much have you tried really understanding and learning the concepts and tools?
* Organization -- did you follow an iterative/incremental development process? Was the process of creating your MVP strategic? Or was it a mess? How do you manage your time?
* Understanding -- how well do you understand what we have learned?
